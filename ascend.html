                          This is my first game development initiative as well as my longest lasting one. 
                          As such, I have learned plenty about the development process through this project including people management skills, how to work efficiently with a seven person group, and the importance of clarity of code and source control. <br>

                          <h3 class="lead"> Leading a team of eight is difficult, let alone eight full-time students on a project purely done out of passion.
                            But through this initially intimidating project, I gained eight new friends and lots of experience of the game development process. <br> <br>
                            I noticed that the three most important qualities that a team needs to function efficiently is clear communication, friendliness between members, and progress.
                            I was lucky and had a great group of people who all got along well. Our biweekly meetings were a time to catch up as friends as well as a time to update the team on our individual progress.
                            We made sure at our meetings to discuss who was in charge of what task and when to expect it to be finished. <br><br>
                            The main challenge I faced as project manager was ensuring there was enough progress done each week. 
                            As a student myself, I understood the time contraints that every member faced. 
                            To remedy this, I distributed more bite-sized tasks that could be finished within an hour or two every meeting. 
                            This extended our project progress schedule, but ensured that there was consistent progress. <br><br>

                        <h3 class="lead"> The features I've implemented include the UI, basic player control, and player interaction with certain objects such as ladders. <br><br>
                          The greatest technical challenge was not scripting any of these functionalities but instead managing the source control for this project. 
                          We used Github as our source control, but had trouble handling all of Unity's generated metadata files and source controlling assets. <br><br>
                          We attempted to resolve this by using a .gitignore for Unity Engine which would filter out most metadata files. 
                          We resolved other conflicts in person at our meetings as a way to remain on the same page and understand the code that other teammates wrote.
                          Art and sound assets are now handled through Google Drive since they do not need to be passed at each commit.
