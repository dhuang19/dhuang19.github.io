                            Developer of 24 hour AI hackathon | August 2017 - September 2018</span></h5>
                          <p class="lead"> Mechmania is a 24 hour AI hackathon held at the annual Reflections Projections conference at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <br><br>
                            I am a developer of the hackathon, specifically a member of the visualizer team. 
                            My teammates and I are responsible for receiving streams of game data and visualizing the data in Unity3D.
                            My specific contributions include bridging the gap between the game engine team and the visualizer team with a custom JSON parser, 
                            creating a map generator for play testing, designing the final map, and implementing some UI elements. <br><br>
                            Below is a video of the gameplay. It is outdated and will be replaced with a final version when it becomes available.

                          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Team Work Experience</h2> <h6><span class="text-muted"></span></h6>
                          <h3 class="lead"> The team consisted on 10 undergraduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
                            We were divided into the visualizer team, game engine team (whose job was to run the game logic and output game logs), and the infrastructure team. <br>
                            One of the challenges we faced was the presence of dependencies in our complex workflow. 
                            For instance, I could not finalize my JSON parser if the game engine team did not finalize the structure of their game logs. 
                            And members of the visualizer team could not begin their work until the JSON parser was finished.
                            We learned the importance of clear communication between members as well as the need to adhere as closely as possible to deadlines we set for ourselves. <br>
                            Overall, we worked cohesively as a group and proudly presented a great MechMania night. I am excited to work with the team again for MechMania 2019 :) <br> <br>
                            Meet the Team! <br>

                          <h3 class="lead">I value the fluidity and the realism of character motion in all the games I play, so I made sure to incorporate that in Elysiam.<br> <br>
                            One of the skills I learned from was blending the transition between animations. All of my animation assets are freely downloadable from the UE4 Marketplace.
                            I reverse engineered the animation blueprint Unreal provided in the asset pack to learn how to use animation state machines, blend spaces, and animation montages. 
                            The provided blueprint only enabled basic walking/running however, so I used what I had learned to build all of the combat skills and respective transitions.
