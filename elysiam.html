                      <p class="lead">I am the sole gameplay programmer, animator, UI designer/engineer, and AI engineer for Elysiam.
                      Elysiam was created with the intention of growing my understanding of different game development roles beyond game programming. 
                      Since the game development industry is extremely multidisciplinary, I think it is important to understand and appreciate the work of developers in fields outside my own. <br><br>
                      I was careful to create a managable scope for my game as I prioritize polish and engaging gameplay over quantity. 
                      The features include dynamic player combat, AI trees, intuitive level design, an immersive environment, an inventory system, and a simple overarching lore.  </p>

                        <h3 class="lead"> While I already have gameplay programming experience from my previous projects, there was still a learning curve with scripting in UE4. <br><br>
                          I learned to utilize the visual scripting tool that Unreal provides and appreciate how simple it made debugging my code since the threads between nodes light up when it passes, allowing me to see exactly where an error occurs.

                      <h3 class="lead">I value the fluidity and the realism of character motion in all the games I play, so I made sure to incorporate that in Elysiam.<br> <br>
                        One of the skills I learned from was blending the transition between animations. All of my animation assets are freely downloadable from the UE4 Marketplace.
                        I reverse engineered the animation blueprint Unreal provided in the asset pack to learn how to use animation state machines, blend spaces, and animation montages. 
                        The provided blueprint only enabled basic walking/running however, so I used what I had learned to build all of the combat skills and respective transitions.

                      <h3 class="lead">All of the design decisions in this game are made to keep Elysiam within scope. <br><br>
                        Elysiam begins with a cinematic where the player character is downed by a boss. Then, the player spawns on a small floating island, a place where fallen souls go.
                        A small message pops up telling the player to reclaim their body. They need to fight their way through two to three simple monsters. One of them will drop a key.
                        At the end of the island is a path of stairs leading to a portal. The player interacts with it and they spawn in the room with the boss in the starting cinematic.
                        They must defeat the boss and reclaim their body. And that is the end of the game. <br><br>
                        The level is designed to be intuitive in terms of where to go without the support of much direct instruction. 
                        The portal and the stairs leading up to it are directly across from where the player spawns and it is the highest point in the map. 
                        There is also a large particle effect at the portal to emphasize where it is.
