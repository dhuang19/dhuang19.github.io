                          I am the sole developer of this space shooter heavily inspired by the arcade game, Asteroids. 
                          This project was made to test my scripting and Unity skills after completing the Unity "Space Shooter Tutorial".
                          <br><br>
                          This game contains many features of the classic arcade game such as a wrapping player field,
                           small asteroids spawning from bigger destroyed asteroids, a simple start menu, and the dynamic movement.

                        <h3 class="lead"> Leading a team of eight is difficult, let alone eight full-time students on a project purely done out of passion.
                          But through this initially intimidating project, I gained eight new friends and lots of experience of the game development process. <br> <br>
                          I noticed that the three most important qualities that a team needs to function efficiently is clear communication, friendliness between members, and progress.
                          I was lucky and had a great group of people who all got along well. Our biweekly meetings were a time to catch up as friends as well as a time to update the team on our individual progress.
                          We made sure at our meetings to discuss who was in charge of what task and when to expect it to be finished. <br><br>
                          The main challenge I faced as project manager was ensuring there was enough progress done each week. 
                          As a student myself, I understood the time contraints that every member faced. 
                          To remedy this, I distributed more bite-sized tasks that could be finished within an hour or two every meeting. 
                          This extended our project progress schedule, but ensured that there was consistent progress. <br><br>
